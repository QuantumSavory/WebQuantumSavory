# WebQuantumSavory (Quantum Network API)

A Julia-based web API for quantum network operations, built with the Genie web framework and QuantumSavory quantum computing library. This API provides endpoints for creating, preparing, and running quantum network simulations.

## Installation

Prerequisites are Julia, Node.js 18 or newer, and npm.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd WebQuantumSavory
   ```

2. **Install Julia dependencies**:
   ```bash
   julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
   ```

## Running the Server

### Option 1: Using the provided script
```bash
./bin/server
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000` by default.
The launcher runs `npm ci` and rebuilds the GUI before starting Genie, so the generated
files under `public/` do not need to be checked into Git.

Before a non-test server begins accepting requests, it synchronously warms the parser,
simulator, protocol and generated-state renderers using the latest bundled demo, then
renders the same default States Zoo state created by the GUI. The private warmup
simulation is removed immediately afterward. This makes initial startup take longer so
the first interactive simulation and visualization requests do not pay Julia compilation
latency. Test-mode startup skips the automatic workload; the backend unit suite exercises
it directly.

## UI Access

The user interface is available at `http://localhost:8000`.

For the bundled UI, API requests default to the current browser origin in production, which keeps the
frontend aligned with the Genie server automatically. If you need to point the built UI at a different
API host, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` when running `npm run build`.

## Local MCP collaboration

WebQuantumSavory includes an optional local Model Context Protocol sidecar for
collaborative design and simulation control. It is disabled by default, binds
only to `127.0.0.1`, and starts only after the user opens the MCP Tools tab and
clicks **Initialize MCP**.

Enable the capability before launching the loopback Genie server:

```bash
WEBQUANTUMSAVORY_ENABLE_MCP=true ./bin/server
```

The MCP endpoint is then shown in the Tools tab and defaults to
`http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp`. Override that port with an unused local port:

```bash
WEBQUANTUMSAVORY_ENABLE_MCP=true \
WEBQUANTUMSAVORY_MCP_PORT=8123 \
./bin/server
```

Both variables are parsed strictly. `WEBQUANTUMSAVORY_ENABLE_MCP` accepts only
the lowercase values `true` and `false`; the port must be an integer from 1 to
65535 and must differ from Genie's port. Enabling MCP while Genie is configured
for a non-loopback host fails closed before the server starts.

The launcher instantiates the isolated `mcp/` Julia environment only when the
feature is enabled. For development, instantiate it directly with:

```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project=mcp -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

The sidecar is intentionally a separate process. ModelContextProtocol 0.6.0
installs a process-global logger, so loading it in Genie would let MCP transport
lifecycle and client log-level requests affect the main application's logging.
Process isolation also keeps the optional dependency graph unloaded when the
feature is disabled and gives Initialize/Stop a clean session boundary. This
cost can be reconsidered when the library exposes scoped logger, single-session,
and lifecycle hooks. Until then, its exact compatibility pin and the annotated
transport adapter must be revalidated together when upgrading the dependency.

The browser remains authoritative for the live project, so a browser tab must
stay bound for design edits and lifecycle actions. MCP edits update the visible
project immediately and mark it unsaved; they never save automatically. One
bound browser tab and one MCP session are supported. Project transitions
automatically unbind the current design. Use `simulation_reset` before changing
simulation-affecting design state after preparation.

The versioned tool contract is in `contracts/mcp/v1/tools.json`. New authoring
tools must first gain a shared `DesignCommandService` handler and migrate the
equivalent GUI action to that handler. Simulation lifecycle tools must continue
to use the browser controller, while simulation reads and HTTP routes share
the Julia `SimulationService`.

## API Overview

### Core Simulation Workflow

1. **Create Network** (`POST /parse_network_graph`) - Upload network graph definition
2. **Prepare Simulation** (`POST /prepare_simulation`) - Launch protocols and setup network
3. **Run Simulation** (`POST /run_simulation`) - Start a cooperative run to an absolute simulation-time target
4. **Monitor State** (`GET /get_state`) - Check simulation status and progress
5. **Cleanup** (`POST /destroy_simulation`) - Remove simulation and free resources

### Simulation Control

- **Pause Simulation** (`POST /pause_simulation`) - Pause a running simulation
  - Requires simulation to be currently running
  - Returns only after the run task stops at a simulation-step boundary
  - Returns error if simulation is not running

`POST /run_simulation` returns HTTP 202 after marking the simulation as running; use
`GET /get_state` to monitor completion or errors. `time_units` is the absolute cumulative target,
not a duration added by the API. To resume a paused simulation, call `/run_simulation` again with
the target already reported in `simulation_time`.

The simulation state includes a `simulation_paused` boolean field that indicates an acknowledged
pause. When it is `true`, `simulation_running` is `false` and the execution task has stopped, so the
simulation can be resumed or safely destroyed.

#### Example: Pausing a Simulation

```bash
# Start a simulation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_simulation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-simulation", "time_units": 100}'

# Pause the simulation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/pause_simulation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-simulation"}'

# Check simulation state
curl http://localhost:8000/get_state?name=my-simulation
```

The state response will show `simulation_paused: true` and `simulation_running: false` when the simulation has been paused.

### Simulation Status Fields

When monitoring simulation state via `GET /get_state`, the response includes a `simulation` object with:
- `simulation_running` - Boolean indicating if simulation is actively running
- `simulation_paused` - Boolean indicating if simulation was paused by user request
- `simulation_time` - Total time units for the simulation
- `simulation_progress` - Current simulation time progress
- `simulation_error` - Error message if simulation failed

## Getting Started

The best way to explore the API is through the interactive Swagger documentation at `/docs`. It provides:
- Complete endpoint documentation
- Request/response schemas
- Interactive testing interface
- Example payloads and responses

### Protocol Inputs and Numeric Expressions

Protocol constructor inputs follow one metadata-driven pipeline:

```text
QuantumSavory constructor metadata
  → backend Julia-type metadata
  → frontend input descriptors
  → minimized base Julia type plus tagged value
```

Every editable constructor parameter begins with a **Default** choice. Default
stores no value and omits the keyword from simulator and script-export payloads,
so the QuantumSavory constructor applies its own default. Catalog `defaultValue`
metadata is help text only; a new project does not copy it into the draft.
Choosing an explicit literal, function, tag, or expression starts an empty
editor and requires a valid value before it is committed.

`Float64` and `Int64` parameters and Variables can use a Julia numeric
expression. The declared type remains `Float64` or `Int64`; project JSON stores
only the source:

```json
{
  "kind": "numeric_expression",
  "source": "delay / 2"
}
```

Validation has four modes:

| Input | Validation result |
| --- | --- |
| Installed node, edge, or floating protocol | Evaluates once with the actual lexical assignment context, casts to the target type, applies metadata bounds, and returns `deferred: false` with the concrete value. |
| Protocol template/layout constructor | Evaluates once with stable representative values for that placement, casts and checks bounds, and returns `deferred: true` with the representative value. Direct inputs display that value with **Representative result; evaluated again when assigned**. |
| Context-free Variable | Lowers once, evaluates that same lowered form once, casts it, and returns `deferred: false` with the value. |
| Context-dependent Variable | Lowers once, detects resolved assignment globals, and returns `deferred: true` without executing the expression body or casting it. |

Only Variables use Julia lowering to decide whether evaluation must wait for an
assignment. Lowering includes macro expansion and therefore runs only behind
the unsafe-evaluation gate. Julia's resolved lowered globals distinguish real
context dependencies from keyword labels, property names, generator bindings,
local assignments, and macro hygiene.

An installed protocol uses its actual context:

- Every placement has `nodeid(name)` over the ordered project node names.
- Node protocols additionally have one-based `self`.
- Edge protocols additionally have `length`, `delay`, `refractive_index`,
  `node_a`, and `node_b`. The three physical values are `null` on virtual
  edges. Unqualified `length` intentionally refers to the edge length;
  `Base.length(collection)` always calls the collection function.
- Floating protocols have only `nodeid(name)`.

Variables conservatively treat unqualified `length` as assignment-dependent
because they can later be linked to an edge. Node and floating contexts do not
shadow ordinary `Base.length`.

Preview results, validation errors, node-name maps, and physical context are
transient and are never saved. A linked template shows the deferred status but
suppresses the representative value; a linked installed protocol shows its
concrete result. A linked expression Variable is evaluated independently at
each protocol assignment. Runtime construction and generated scripts use the
same lexical bindings and target cast. Script export validates the strict tag
and complete Julia syntax only: it never lowers, macro-expands, or executes
user source in the server.

When unsafe evaluation is enabled, `POST /test_numeric_expression` accepts:

```json
{
  "expression": "delay / 2",
  "target_type": "Float64",
  "placement": "edge",
  "context": {
    "node_names": ["Alice", "Bob"],
    "length": 100.0,
    "delay": 5e-7,
    "refractive_index": 1.5,
    "node_a": 1,
    "node_b": 2
  }
}
```

Allowed target types are `Float64` and `Int64`; placements are `node`, `edge`,
`floating`, and `variable`. Node context adds one-based `self`; floating
context contains only `node_names`. Successful evaluated results return the
cast value as a precision-safe string:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": {
    "deferred": false,
    "target_type": "Float64",
    "value": "2.5e-7"
  }
}
```

A contextual Variable success is deferred without `value`. A template success
is also deferred but includes its representative `value`. Omitted `context` is
accepted only for an explicit template request and Variables. Malformed request
data returns HTTP 400, disabled evaluation returns HTTP 403, and parse,
evaluation, or cast failures use `error_code: "EVALUATION_FAILED"` with
production redaction.

### Trusted Julia Evaluation

`POST /test_code`, `POST /test_symbolic_expression`,
`POST /test_numeric_expression`, custom functions, symbolic values, numeric
expressions, and fallback conversion of complex parameters can execute Julia
code in the API server process. A fresh module isolates names, but does not
restrict filesystem, process, network, memory, or CPU access. Treat saved
expression source as trusted code and do not enable these features for
untrusted users.

Unsafe evaluation is enabled by default only in Genie's `dev` and `test`
environments. It is disabled in `prod` and unrecognized environments. Operators
can override either default with one environment variable:

```bash
WEBQUANTUMSAVORY_ENABLE_UNSAFE_EVALUATION=true ./bin/server
```

The value is parsed strictly: only `true` or `false` are accepted, ignoring case
and surrounding whitespace. Keep the variable unset or set it to `false` in
production unless the deployment intentionally trusts every API caller and
simulation payload. When disabled, evaluation requests return HTTP 403 with
`error_code: "UNSAFE_EVALUATION_DISABLED"`. Evaluation exceptions are included
only in `dev` and `test` responses, even when evaluation is explicitly enabled
in another environment.

When enabled, use `POST /test_symbolic_expression` to evaluate a symbolic
expression in a fresh module with QuantumSavory preloaded and get its LaTeX
representation. Numeric literals remain usable when unsafe evaluation is
disabled, and saved expression source remains viewable, but validating or
executing numeric expressions is unavailable.

Example request body:

```json
{ "expr": "(Z₁⊗Z₁+Z₂⊗Z₂) / √2" }
```

Successful response:

```json
{ "success": true, "results": { "latex": "... LaTeX string ...", "value": "..." } }
```

On error, you'll receive:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "<message>", "error_code": "EVALUATION_FAILED" }
```

## Running Tests

This project includes unit tests and integration tests.

- Unit tests validate core logic and helpers without requiring a running server.
- Integration tests exercise the HTTP API and require the server to be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
cd test
julia --project runtests.jl test_unit
```

Focused MCP backend tests can be run with:

```bash
cd test
julia --project runtests.jl test_mcp_unit
```

The isolated sidecar contract-loader tests use its own environment:

```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project=mcp mcp/test/runtests.jl
```

Notes:
- Unit tests include deterministic checks for the background cleanup via `cleanup_stale_simulations_once()`.
- When creating states from payloads in tests, always call `WebQuantumSavory.validate_payload(payload)` before `WebQuantumSavory.parse_network_graph(...)`.

### Run Integration Tests

1. Start the server (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   ./bin/server
   ```

2. In another terminal, run:
   ```bash
   cd test
   julia --project runtests.jl test_integration
   ```

### CI checks

GitHub Actions and Buildkite run the same five repository scripts:

```bash
./ci/backend-unit.sh
./ci/mcp-unit.sh
./ci/frontend-build.sh
./ci/backend-integration.sh
./ci/browser.sh
```

Each script installs the locked project dependencies it needs, so it can run
from a clean checkout once its language runtimes are available. The MCP,
integration, and browser scripts start a test-mode backend, wait up to 120
seconds for `/status`, and always stop it. On failure they preserve the backend
log and any Playwright traces under the ignored `ci-artifacts/` directory.

The browser script downloads the Chromium version locked by Playwright. On a
new Linux machine, install the locked npm dependencies and its system packages
first:

```bash
npm --prefix gui ci --include=dev
(cd gui && npx playwright install-deps chromium)
```

For Buildkite, configure the pipeline's upload step as
`buildkite-agent pipeline upload`. The JuliaCI plugin downloads Julia 1.12 and
uses an isolated, pipeline-specific depot. The official mise plugin installs
the pinned mise release and the Node.js 24 toolchain declared in `mise.toml`.
The browser step installs the locked Chromium binary and its Linux packages
through Playwright. The MCP, integration, and browser jobs use distinct backend
ports and concurrency groups. They can run together, while overlapping builds
of the same job remain serialized so their fixed backend, sidecar, or Vite
ports cannot contend.

Each Linux agent must still provide Git, Bash, curl, wget, tar, and Python 3.
Browser agents must use a Playwright-supported Debian/Ubuntu base and let the
job install apt packages as root or through passwordless `sudo`. Agents must be
able to download Julia, mise, Node.js, npm packages, and Chromium, and ports
8000 through 8003, 5173, and 18001 must be available. No queue name, secret,
or container image is assumed by `.buildkite/pipeline.yml`. Configure
Buildkite's GitHub integration to create builds for pull requests and pushes
to `main`.

## Automatic Cleanup of Inactive Simulations

The system includes a background task that releases resources held by inactive simulations and eventually removes their retained status records.

- Service function: `WebQuantumSavory.cleanup_stale_simulations()` (in `src/services.jl`)
- Frequency: every 60 seconds
- After 30 minutes: block the simulation and release heavy resources while retaining status for the UI
- After another 300 minutes without activity: destroy the retained simulation record
- Skips cleanup when `state.is_running == true`
- Startup: launched from `routes.jl` inside `bootstrap()` via

  ```julia
  @async WebQuantumSavory.cleanup_stale_simulations() |> errormonitor
  ```

- Logging: both automatic blocking and destruction add an event to the simulation's captured log before releasing its state.

You can trigger a single cleanup pass manually (useful in tests) via `WebQuantumSavory.cleanup_stale_simulations_once()`.
Running simulations also have a separate 10-minute wall-clock execution limit.
