# Changelog

## 1.11.0

- Added the shared metadata-backed constructor input experience to slot
  backgrounds, including defaults, typed literals, compatible Variables,
  guarded `Float64`/`Int64` expressions, bounds, contextual `self` and
  `nodeid`, template reevaluation, persistence, simulator construction, and
  generated-script parity.
- Background Variable references now participate in project-wide deletion
  guards, and cloned Layout Tools backgrounds are revalidated with each new
  node's concrete context before their transactional design update commits.

- Made physical-link rendering, automatic distance and delay, and badge
  placement share one geodesically densified route, including short-path
  antimeridian rendering. Curve mode now controls handle editing only and
  never changes a stored route's geometry.
- Added a default-deny allowlist guard that walks parsed Custom Function,
  numeric-expression, and Symbolic source and rejects any non-allowlisted
  identifier or dangerous syntactic form (module qualification and property
  access via `.`, macros, interpolation, imports, `ccall`, and the `getfield`
  family) immediately before the existing pipeline evaluates it. The guard
  reuses Julia's own parser and evaluator, performs no lowering or macro
  expansion, and is one defense-in-depth layer on top of the
  `WEBQUANTUMSAVORY_ENABLE_UNSAFE_EVALUATION` gate — not a security boundary.
- Renamed the edge-length lexical binding from `length` to `distance` in Custom
  Function, numeric-expression, and Symbolic source (and the corresponding
  numeric-expression context field). Because `length` no longer shadows the
  function, edge and variable sources may now call `length(collection)`
  directly.

## 1.10.1

- Added descriptor-driven physical quantities and unit metadata for global and
  per-edge refractive index, fiber loss, propagation delay, and
  transmissivity, with a default fiber loss of 0.2 dB/km.
- Added automatic distance-and-loss transmissivity, bounded manual overrides,
  reset behavior, dormant loss preservation, legacy schema-v1 normalization,
  and material-aware generated-edge inheritance without persisting derived
  values.
- Added resolved `loss` and `transmissivity` edge bindings across Custom
  Functions, numeric-expression previews and Variables, simulator runtime, and
  executable generated scripts, while retaining nullable compatibility for
  legacy and virtual-edge payloads.
- Generalized physical-default design commands to validated partial updates
  and synchronized the GUI, MCP schema, backend validation, Swagger, browser
  workflows, and project round trips with the additive contracts.

## 1.10.0

- Added one Default-first input selector for every editable protocol parameter
  and Variable, with omitted constructor defaults and explicit empty value
  validation across singleton, union, function, intrinsic, and named-tag
  inputs.
- Added tagged Julia numeric expressions for `Float64` and `Int64` protocol
  parameters and Variables, including concrete placement previews,
  representative template results, lowering-based contextual-Variable
  deferral, per-assignment runtime evaluation, and parse-only script export
  that does not lower, macro-expand, or execute source in the server.
- Made edited and pending numeric-expression and custom-code drafts explicit
  constructor validation errors, and reused descriptor completeness checks in
  Variables and repeater generation so stale or empty explicit branches cannot
  silently generate as Default.
- Extended the existing trusted-code evaluation gate, API documentation, GUI
  and MCP design-command contract, project normalization, and browser coverage
  for the new descriptor and numeric-expression inputs.

## 1.9.2

- Watermarked every generated protocol, slot-state, and States Zoo PNG in the browser with
  `QuantumSavory.org`.
- Parallelized Buildkite's server-backed checks on isolated ports while retaining
  per-job serialization across overlapping builds.
- Kept curved-edge drawing and geodesic length calculation stable during world-wrapped
  node drags by previewing moves outside project state, transactionally rejecting unsupported
  geometry with an in-app warning, and restoring the node and curve handle.
- Made nullable protocol Tag parameters use the shared Default/Nothing/Tag type selector and
  reveal the named-tag autocomplete only for Tag, while retaining the direct autocomplete for
  Tag-only parameters.
- Added edge distance, delay, refractive index, and endpoint IDs as runtime/export-parity
  custom-function context, with the expanded reference moved into a compact helper popup.
- Rendered the repository changelog in System Information through the shared safe
  Markdown presentation pipeline.
- Made generated Julia scripts use concise explicit imports for exporter-owned
  helpers and constructors while preserving the broad package context available
  to user-authored symbolic and custom-function source.

## 1.9.1

- Added project-persisted template-node slots and background-noise settings to Physical Defaults, with fresh independent slot copies applied through every standard node-creation path.
- Reused one slot editor for selected and template nodes, and kept the Layout Tools Help card sized to its content as the Tools panel grows.

## 1.9.0

- Added advanced Qubit and Qumode representation defaults with backend-capability guidance, persistent project settings, and matching GUI-simulation and Julia-script-export behavior.
- Added dependency-backed Bézier routing for physical links with typed smooth/sharp anchors, geodesic distance and propagation-delay badges, editable physical defaults and per-edge overrides, and schema-v1 legacy normalization.
- Applied each resolved physical-link delay to both directed classical and quantum simulator channels and generated scripts, while excluding virtual links from physical graphs and retaining their permitted protocols.
- Fixed wrapped Tools tabs and reorganized Layout Tools into a full-width live-help card above equal Physical Defaults, Drawing Tools, and Helpers cards, with consistent pointer and keyboard-focus guidance.
- Added persisted frontend-only map annotations with safe Markdown and LaTeX, fill and border colors, one-shot placement, selection, dragging, minimum-size corner resizing, deletion, and editing throughout every simulation phase.
- Added optional transparent dashed annotation areas whose independently persisted `freeCorner` selects a dominant normalized-axis attachment, always shares a positive annotation-edge segment instead of a lone corner, and expands across the full edge when the selection extends beyond it, while keeping annotation data out of simulator and generated-script payloads.
- Added composable log filtering by severity, normalized App/Web API/Simulator source, and authoritative QuantumSavory simulator group, including canonical recovery for resumable protocol logs while retaining their structured metadata in searchable Raw JSON.
- Added a structured simulation log explorer with extensible group, event, protocol, node, severity, source, and simulated-time filtering; exact large identities; node-name resolution; structured event context; and legacy-log compatibility.
- Added an MCP server for collaborative local work with an AI agent.

## 1.8.0

- Added immediate, accessible loading feedback for simulation setup and application-shell initialization while keeping ordinary execution, polling, tag previews, plots, and script export on their existing local indicators.
- Made Markdown tooltips stack consistently above application overlays for both top and bottom placements.
- Added documented local-run steps and an accessible System Information dialog with Julia, Genie, QuantumSavory provenance, WebQuantumSavory, and exact frontend dependency versions; copied panic reports now include the same normalized diagnostics.
- Clarified startup warmup as precompilation work and kept its internal simulator logs out of server output.
- Added metadata-driven, force-selection autocomplete for protocol named-tag types, with authoritative `AbstractTag` validation during construction and script export.

## 1.7.1

- Added a metadata-driven Tags & Queries explorer for live simulations, with a shared wrapping badge sequence for progressive named, Symbol, and allowlisted DataType construction; previews; Register targets spanning All slots or one selected slot; message-buffer inspection and mutation; and non-consuming FILO queries with exact, wildcard, preset, and policy-gated custom predicates. Constructors now precede their results, while rendered text, IDs, slot context, time, source, and buffer depth stay behind result disclosure.
- Rendered every PrimeVue directive tooltip through the Description panel's safe Markdown and KaTeX pipeline, including structured catalog help and preformatted backend diagnostics, while leaving native browser `title` text unchanged.
- Synchronized the frontend package and API documentation metadata with the application release version so release bumps remain consistent across shared CI checks and public version surfaces.
- Made CI server ownership checks tolerate hosts whose socket tools cannot report process metadata, while still requiring the launched Genie server to confirm that it is listening.

## 1.7.0

- Added opt-in repeater-chain automation for fresh EntanglerProt, SwapperProt, and EntanglementTracker construction, including eager, sequential, and binary-tree swap predicates generated from stable node names.
- Unified protocol constructor fields and Layout Helper dialog/help patterns so metadata defaults, variables, custom-function validation, accessibility guidance, and responsive actions behave consistently.
- Unified complete-source parsing and placement-aware context for Custom Function validation, runtime construction, and script export; added regression coverage for curried and named functions, allowed multi-statement sources and trailing comments, and made validation failures readable from the warning tooltip.
- Added backend-managed `nodeid("Node name")` and node-only `self` bindings to custom Julia functions and Lambda variables, with matching exported-script behavior and in-app guidance.
- Named simulator and exported-script registers after their configured nodes so log messages identify nodes clearly.
- Added clipboard image pasting to the project Description editor, inserting safe bitmap images as Markdown data URLs at the current selection.
- Warmed the simulator, protocol and generated-state renderers, and the default States Zoo preview during server startup so first GUI interactions avoid Julia compilation latency; temporary assigned states are now fully traced out during cleanup.

## 1.6.0

- Added schema-v1 project normalization with consistently trimmed project names, editing locks after Parse and through Prepare, shared dialog and button primitives, and a brand-aligned light PrimeVue palette.
- Made the bottom Tools panel resizable upward and to the right with cursor-only border affordances, persistent dimensions, viewport-aware bounds, and compact collapse behavior.
- Added a dismissible full-screen warning when the simulator is opened on a phone or other small viewport.
- Added template-driven star, 2D grid, and all-to-all network layout helpers with deterministic geometry and 1-based clone names.
- Added a default-on repeater-chain option for a direct virtual edge between the endpoints and stabilized generated edge ordering across save/reload.
- Added an Export Script tools tab with highlighted, downloadable, backend-generated Julia for running the configured simulation, plus pedagogical animation and protocol-visualization recipes.
- Kept the Simulation Runner's Play control visible but disabled, with guidance, until the network is defined.
- Replaced UI icon fonts, hand-drawn control artwork, and plain icon glyphs with semantically selected Lucide icons, including PrimeVue and JSON viewer controls, while retaining MapLibre's native navigation controls.
- Added a persisted Markdown project Description tab with safe data-image support, inline and display LaTeX rendering, and explicit edit/save/cancel controls.
- Added node reordering with visible simulator IDs, ID tooltips, and stable edge, selection, map, and project persistence behavior.
- Moved log-level counters into the Logs tab and shortened the containing panel title to Tools.
- Added simulation-wide typed variables that can be defined in the Variables tab and assigned to node, edge, or floating protocol parameters.
- Added JSON persistence and backend validation for variable definitions and protocol assignments, including legacy-project compatibility and simulation-state edit locking.
- Filtered protocol variable pickers to field-compatible types, with explicit selection and availability guidance.
- Made Symbolic value editors collapse to their rendered result after successful validation, with compact protocol defaults and click-to-edit reopening.
- Made generated scripts follow Tools panel resizing, restored visible native-button hover text, and aligned custom-function validation with the Symbolic editor's compact result lifecycle.
- Added a States Zoo tools tab for defining symbolic state variables from the five allowlisted QuantumSavory state types, with metadata-driven parameter controls and debounced rendered previews.
- Added safe structured States Zoo recipes that persist with projects and remain available to compatible protocol parameters without enabling unsafe symbolic evaluation.
- Added States Zoo catalog and PNG preview API endpoints with strict type, parameter, numeric, and range validation plus serialized CairoMakie rendering.
- Exposed every upstream States Zoo type through the explicit whitelist, marked weighted states consistently, normalized their symbolic values and previews, and added synchronized trace variables with heralding-probability guidance while keeping generated Zoo variables out of the ordinary Variables tab and recomputing exported traces alongside their normalized states.
- Added a tabbed bottom panel with Logs and Layout Tools views.
- Added a repeater chain generator that clones configured repeater nodes and edges into an evenly spaced chain.
